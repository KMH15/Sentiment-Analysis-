Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "NLP Final.ipynb," which implements a sentiment analysis project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to classify tweets into different sentiment categories.

Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on tweets to categorize them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment classes.

Notebook Overview
The Jupyter Notebook "NLP Final.ipynb" contains the following sections:

Data Preparation:

The notebook begins by loading a labeled dataset ("labeled_data.csv") containing tweets and their corresponding sentiment labels.
The dataset is preprocessed to remove noise, special characters, URLs, and emojis. It is also converted to lowercase and tokenized.
Stop words are removed, and words are lemmatized to obtain the root form.
Feature Extraction:

The text data is transformed into numerical features using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique.
The TF-IDF vectorizer is used to convert the preprocessed text data into feature vectors.
Sentiment Classification:

Three different classifiers are trained and evaluated for sentiment classification: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression.
The classifiers are trained on the TF-IDF feature vectors and evaluated using classification reports and accuracy scores.
How to Use
To run this notebook and perform sentiment analysis on your own data, follow these steps:

Install Required Libraries:

The notebook requires the following libraries: pandas, nltk, emoji, scikit-learn, and gensim.
Ensure you have these libraries installed on your system. You can use the following commands to install them:
diff
Copy code
!pip install pandas nltk emoji scikit-learn gensim
Clone the Repository:

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the "NLP Final.ipynb" notebook file directly from the repository.
Run the Notebook:

Open the "NLP Final.ipynb" notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, and perform sentiment analysis.
You can replace the dataset ("labeled_data.csv") with your own data and modify the code as needed.
Analyze the Results:

Once the notebook execution is complete, you will get the sentiment classification results and accuracy scores for the trained classifiers.
Dataset
The notebook uses the "labeled_data.csv" dataset, which contains tweets labeled with their respective sentiments. For demonstration purposes, the dataset is limited to the first 10,000 rows.

Please ensure you have the "labeled_data.csv" file available in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code to use your own dataset.

Note
The notebook was automatically generated by Google Colab and might contain additional output or Colab-specific comments.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use the code for your own sentiment analysis projects!

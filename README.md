## Introduction

- Sentiment analysis involves classifying text data into positive, negative or neutral sentiment categories. 
- In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on tweets to categorize their sentiment.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter notebook `NLP Final.ipynb` contains:

### Data Preprocessing

- Loading labeled tweet dataset 
- Cleaning data - remove noise, emoji, lowercase etc.
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization

### Feature Extraction  

- TF-IDF vectors to transform text into features

### Model Building

- Compare classifiers:
  - SVM
  - Decision Tree
  - Logistic Regression
- Evaluate models using accuracy, classification reports.

## Usage

To run this project:

- Install required libraries like Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-Learn
- Clone this repo and open Jupyter Notebook
- Run notebook cells end-to-end
- Replace sample data with your own
- Analyze sentiment classification results
